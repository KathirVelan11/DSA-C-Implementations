# DSA Implementations in C

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms using the C programming language.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `Binary Search Tree` - Array and Linked List implementations, level-order traversal, BST checks.
- `Graph` - Traversals (BFS/DFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall).
- `LinkedList` - Singly, Doubly, Circular lists and common operations.
- `Queue` - Array and Linked List implementations, circular deque.
- `Sorting` - Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick sort.
- `Stacks` - Stack operations, expression evaluations, string reversals.

## ðŸ›  Language

- All code is written in **C**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These programs were created for academic learning and practice. Feel free to explore, use, and improve upon them.
